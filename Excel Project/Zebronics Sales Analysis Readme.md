📌 Project Proposal

This project aims to analyze Zebronics’ sales performance across India using a dataset of 18,000 transactions (2023–2024).

The dataset captures customer demographics, sales channels, products, and revenue, enabling insights into:

Customer behavior (age groups, regional differences).

Sales performance across platforms (Flipkart, Amazon, Tata CLiQ).

Geographical distribution of revenue and demand.

Seasonality and time-based sales trends.

The outcomes will support data-driven decision-making for sales optimization, marketing strategies, and customer targeting.
